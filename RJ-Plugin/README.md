## RJ-Plugin
RJ-Plugin is a TTworkbench plugin that supports communication with webservices via http-REST. 
Currently the following functionality is supported: 

 - JSON encoded data (only)
 - GET and POST
 
 We will further develop and enhance this plugin. Please note that this plugin is in a very early status. Nevertheless we encourage you 
 to give us feedback by emailing us directly at: vassiliou-gioles@tu-berlin.de
